/**
 * Reconcile a freshly-pushed sidebar snapshot against the one already held,
 * reusing every object that did not actually change.
 *
 * The server dedupes sidebar pushes by serializing the whole snapshot, so a
 * push only arrives when *something* moved. But "something" is usually one
 * field on one row — a running chat's reply preview, or its `lastAgentMessageAt`
 * — while every other row, group and array is byte-identical. Handing React a
 * wholly new object graph for that turns a one-row change into a full re-render
 * of every project group, every chat row, and every context menu and hover card
 * hanging off them.
 *
 * So the identities are rebuilt bottom-up: an unchanged row keeps its object, a
 * group whose rows all kept theirs keeps its array *and* its object, and a
 * snapshot whose groups all kept theirs is returned as the previous snapshot
 * outright. `memo` then does the rest — the one row that moved re-renders and
 * nothing else does.
 *
 * The comparisons are field-by-field rather than a JSON compare: this runs on
 * every push, and stringifying the snapshot again to find out it was the same
 * is the cost we are here to avoid.
